### Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I am a computational biologist intwrested in statistical modeling, systems biology and high throughput data analysis. 

Currently I am a posdoctoral researcher in [Wise Lab](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/rpwise/) at Iowa State University building gene regulatory networks and epistasis models from RNASeq to describe the temporal control of of immunity to powdery mildew in barley.

## Education:
- PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Iowa State University, USA
- MS is in Biomedical Research. Univertity of Valladolid, Spain
- Biology. University of Antioquia, Colombia
- BS Biological Engineering. National University of Colombia

## Some of my projects
- Y2H-SCORES and NGPINT are software to analyze high throughput Y2H data and proiritize protein-protein interactions. Here you can find the repositories and the publications
NGPINT: https://github.com/Wiselab2/NGPINT 
Y2H-SCORES: https://github.com/vvelasqz/Y2H-SCORES

- I extended Y2H-SCORES to work with mass spectomertry Co-IP data, as you can see here https://github.com/vvelasqz/BC1

- In systems biology I developed an integration framework to study barley immunity by integrating interactome, RNASeq, eQTL and Y2H-NGIS data. Here you can find the [details](https://github.com/vvelasqz/Barley_Interactome ) and the [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.02.466982v1) of this work 

- Other projects where I am collaborating include the comparisson of molecular markers to characterize clinical isolates of [fusarium](https://github.com/vvelasqz/Fusarium_Genotyping), work that has been published [here](https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/5869/4919/)

## Interests
- Proud representative of the [Fulbright](https://fulbright.edu.co/) and [Schlumberger faculty for the future programs](https://www.slb.com/who-we-are/schlumberger-foundation). 
- Commited to increasing diversity in STEM
- My personal interests include cooking, gardening and dancing latin music
