### Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I am a computational biologist interested in statistical modeling, systems biology and high throughput data analysis. 

Currently I am a posdoctoral researcher in [Wise Lab](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/rpwise/) at Iowa State University building gene regulatory networks and epistasis models from RNASeq to describe the temporal control of of immunity to powdery mildew in barley.

## :mortar_board: Education:
- PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Iowa State University, USA
- MS is in Biomedical Research. Univertity of Valladolid, Spain
- BS Biology. University of Antioquia, Colombia
- BS Biological Engineering. National University of Colombia

## :notebook: Some of my projects
- Y2H-SCORES is a software to analyze high throughput Y2H data and proiritize protein-protein interactions. Here you can find the [repository](https://github.com/vvelasqz/Y2H-SCORES) and the [publication](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008890)

- I extended Y2H-SCORES to work with mass spectomertry Co-IP data, as you can see [here](https://github.com/vvelasqz/BC1)

- In systems biology I developed [Interact-omics](https://github.com/vvelasqz/Barley_Interactome ) an integration framework to study barley immunity by integrating interactome, RNASeq, eQTL and Y2H-NGIS data. This work has been submitted for [publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.02.466982v1) 
- I am currently developing different workflows for transcriptome analysis. [TranscriptoNET](https://github.com/vvelasqz/TranscriptoNET) includes differential expression analysis, visualization, Gene Regulatory Networks and epistasis models. 

If you want more details you can find my CV [here](https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://github.com/vvelasqz/CV/raw/main/cv_vvz.pdf&embedded=true)
